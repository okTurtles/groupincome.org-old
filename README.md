#### Getting started

If you haven't already, you'll need to install [Hexo](https://hexo.io):

``` bash
npm install hexo-cli -g
```

Clone the website repo & install dependencies:

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/okTurtles/groupincome.org.git
$ cd groupincome.org/
$ npm install
```

To generate static files from `/source`:

``` bash
$ hexo generate
```

To run the Hexo server:

``` bash
$ hexo server
```

The [Hexo server](https://hexo.io/docs/server.html) will watch for file changes/additions and update automatically, so it's not necessary to restart the server to see most changes. However, if you install or update [Hexo plugins](https://hexo.io/docs/plugins.html) or make changes to either `_config.yml` file, you'll need to restart the server to see the changes.
